//take a string of words ina  sentence and reverse it

 return str.split(" ").reverse().join(" ");

 //something that frequently happens in web development
 //converting between different data types i.e. between strings and arrays

 //array method join 

 //string method split 
 /*
if you wanna convert forma  string to an array you call the split method.  
will take the entire string and split it based on what you place as the argument
of the method... i think it has to find it in the string though. lets try that .  ok so im right... the split method has to be related to the string. i.e. if your string doesnt have a q then you cant use q to split it. 

you can also use regular expressions with the split method

split also turns the original string into an array k
by using split with an empty string you will be splitting on every single character

every single character there is nothing so that is what you are splitting it on 

string.split('')



JOIN METHOD
join will do the exact opposite of split and just join
