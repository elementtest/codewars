/*
each letter scores points according to position in the alphabet
i.e.
a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 etc

for example the score of abad is 8 (1 + 2 + 1 + 4) 

you need to return the highest scoring word as a string

if two words score the same, return the word that appears earliest in the original string

all letters will be lowercase and all inputs will be valid


TLDR: 

input : string of letters
output : score based on 1 = a and 26 = z
